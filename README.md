I'm always too much annoyed when my disk space suddenyl started to become almost empty. That's why I decided to create a small CLI tool for checking the biggest files/folders so that you can clean it up if neeeded.

To run

```
cargo run your_path folder|file num_of_items_to_return

cargo /Users/example folder 5 
```
